Why I'm taking this bootcamp?
I saw a friends post on Facebook about MAX and something clicked. I spent much of my life doing things I thought my family would want me to do with poor end results. I am finally doing something in which I have a strong interest.
What is the most important thing for me to learn?
I could not tell you one thing that is most important at this point. I hope to take in as much information as I can during class and also learn outside of class. Already I am hooked.
What do I want to do after the bootcamp?
I am not sure yet. In broad strokes I need a job because I left my last one to do this bootcamp. If I have what it takes I would like to be in software development.
